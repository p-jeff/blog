Sketch it, and throw together a prototype as quickly as possible.\nWhile you might detect obvious flaws with the given object it also reveals things you previously have not thought of.\nIn the above pictured personal immersion heating unit (innitialy imagined as a cooling unit), there are obvious flaws. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003EHow do you charge it? \u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EHow often do you have to charge it?

When trying to tell a story however there is some value in explaining away these issues as well. What does the object tell you about the world it exists in?\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\u003Cli\u003ECharging in done remotely through induction\u003C\u002Fli\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003ERather than have a battery in your mouth you carry a distant induction device with you.

You will just be surrounded by induction close to your head the entire time. If you do not have it, restaurants requiring it will just serve you cold food. And rather than fixing the design flaws that activecly hurt you, the design “fixes” you to accomodate it.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EObviously this is a very rough example but the whole process took less than two hours, i found a jaw model online, 3D Printed it, painted some teeth and glued a random coil i found to it.\nI do like to prototype the objects, but making some sketches or a 3D Model would work just fine. As long as you act on the initial idea, you might find glaring flaws or great features. It also helps if it is something only partially related to the actual project as it will help you get a different perspective on things.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E",""],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
